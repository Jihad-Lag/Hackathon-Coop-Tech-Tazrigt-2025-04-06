# Tazrigt - Hackathon Coop-Tech 🛠
Built during the **Hackathon Coop-Tech** at **Souss Massa Innovation City**

## About the Project  
We participated in the Coop-Tech Hackathon and developed an application focused on **diagnostic data** easily and efficiently.  
The application was designed with simplicity and usability in mind.  

✨ We also built a custom Python feature that allows users to add diagnostics dynamically — improving workflow and saving time!
